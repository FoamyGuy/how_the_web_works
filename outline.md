- A Web Introduction
    - Strategies for learning technology
        - Start small
        - understand the basics before building on top
        - practice is very important
        - typing code for yourself helps train muscle memory and gives most people a better understanding of how things work together
        - troubleshooting is part of the process
            - list things you assume are true
            - add print statements, or logging outputs to confirm the assumptions
            - inspect very small sections at a time
            - re-check things even if you think you've already ensured their good
        - ask questions

    - How the Web is made
        - Servers hosting content
        - Browsers requesting content on behalf of users
        - bots and other software requesting content automatically

            - [markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org/) often used for [readme files and documentation](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
            - [scss](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - compiled css can include variables
            - [typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) - compiled javascript enforces type more aggressively
            - [ReactJS and JSX](https://reactjs.org/)
        - Backend Technologies
            - Using another programming language to generate html, css, and js
            - Database storage
            - PHP
            - Node.JS
            - Python
            - templating languages like [Jinja](https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/)
        - These are some of the most widely utilized on the web today, but many other technologies exist
