- A Web Introduction
    - Strategies for learning technology
        - Start small
        - understand the basics before building on top
        - practice is very important
        - typing code for yourself helps train muscle memory and gives most people a better understanding of how things work together
        - troubleshooting is part of the process
            - list things you assume are true
            - add print statements, or logging outputs to confirm the assumptions
            - inspect very small sections at a time
            - re-check things even if you think you've already ensured their good
