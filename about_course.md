In this course we will take a surface level look at many of the technologies and other aspects that come together into the web as we know it today.

We will examine different parts of the system to get a feel for how they work and how you can use them to suit your needs as a website creator or developer.

We will also look at some of the more meta and non-technical but still very relavent conepts and ideas that are important within the web and software industries.

Tell me a bit yourself and what your interested in learning from this course.
